ASEN 1320 Estimating the Angle of Attack and Sideslip for Aircraft

**Background**
    Angles of attack and sideslip are very important parameters determining the safety of the flight.Knowledge of them allows for improving the stability and controllability of the aircraft and it is especially important during take-off and landing. To avoid a situation leading to a critical angle of attack, modern aircraft are equipped with measurement and warning systems designed to alert the pilot or to automatically control the plane by limiting dangerous flight ranges.

**Objective**
      The purpose of this project was to transform the velocity vector from the NED to the body frame (x,y,z), by calculating the yaw, pitch, and roll rotations and applying the transformations in a single step. Additionally, the standard deviation of the time vector, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip were calculated for the plane. All of the computations above were done through the use of C++.
